Welcome to this TDD for Dynamics 365 / CDS session!
=====================================================

Samples for 365 saturday session in Kiev 2019 about Test Driven Development for Dynamics 365 / CDS


Server-side unit testing
============================================

For server-side unit testing please check out this repo.

FakeXrmEasy basically mocks the crmsdk calls in .net

Client-site unit testing
==============================================

We're going to basically use 2 projects: xrm-mock (for unit testing of the Xrm Form logic), and fakexrmeasy.js to mock the Web API endpoint from a javascript / typescript perspective.
